What is the format of the input graph?  
[JTDec] [createTreeDec] number of lines: \<number of vertices in the graph G\>  
[JTDec] [createTreeDec] successors are: \<outgoing edges of vertices in the graph G\>

width: \<maximum width among all bags>  
numberOfVertices: \<number of bags>  
root: \<root of the tree>  
height: \<height of the tree>  
parents: \<parent of bags>  
children: \<children of bags>  
bags: \<details of bags>  
rootBags: \<rootBags of nodes of the original graph G>  
levels: \<levels of vertices in the tree>
